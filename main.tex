\section{Introduction}

% Buildings of the Digital Era
Humans are spending a significant amount of time inside increasingly digital buildings \cite{alavi2016future}. Information and communication technologies (ICT) and building energy management systems (BEMS) have resulted in buildings transforming from inanimate structures into interactive and communicative objects \cite{nembrini2017human}. Human occupancy of such spaces results in unfamiliar human-human and human-building interactions whereby buildings now play a more innate role in impacting humans. And although buildings of the digital age can intelligently react to environmental variables such as temperature, light, and air quality \cite{bluyssen2009indoor, moreno2014user}, the buildings' human-centric and empathic behaviour towards occupants remains under-explored. 

% Empathic design for buildings
Human empathy is experienced and conveyed through emotional exchanges based on human experiences. The emotions expressed can take the form of voice and speech patterns, facial expressions, body language, and behavioural patterns \cite{riess2017science}. These cues are recognised by humans, who infer and respond accordingly. Empathy design in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) has therefore focused on developing methods to enable digital technologies to provide ``for the full range of human experience." \cite{wright2008empathy}. With the \blue{digitalisation} of buildings, there is a need to consider them as digital artefacts that too can cater to the full spectrum of human experiences \cite{derix2014empathic}. 

% position
In this position paper, we consider buildings of the digital age that combine architecture with intelligent artefacts. These buildings can enable novel sensory perception of spaces by humans and thereby engender novel human-building interactions. \blue{We posit the need for buildings that can be empathic towards occupants by inferring occupants' affective states and interacting with occupants in a manner that caters to their subjective experiences, thereby enhancing occupants' well-being.}

% We posit the need for empathic design of buildings that can infer occupants' affective states and interact with occupants in a manner that caters to their subjective experiences in such a way as to improve occupant well-being. 

% paper outline
The remainder of this paper provides a background on architecture in the digital age and the move towards architectural solutions that cater to humans. We then talk about one such smart building and speculate how it can be made empathic. To that end, we describe our case study as a preliminary step towards designing empathic buildings by understanding the needs and experiences of occupants of the smart building. 


\section{Background}
% HBI
Architecture in recent years has begun to question a technologically driven, \blue{human-centric} design of space at a time when urban densification, sustainability and mental health have become increasing priorities \cite{derix2014empathic}. On the other hand, human-building interaction (HBI) is a burgeoning area of research that focuses on capturing, understanding and enhancing human interactions and experiences both with and within ``smart built environments" \cite{alavi2016future}. The mutual goal of these two fields \blue{revolves} around understanding,  envisioning and shaping the future of living spaces and all that they encompass \cite{nembrini2017human, alavi2018artifacts}. 

% Examples of work in buildings catering to human needs
In this context, there are several interdisciplinary works that aim to develop human-centric and responsible buildings. For example, smart, sustainable building facades are being developed that adapt to the external environment and react in an energy efficient manner \cite{ahmed2015development}. Other works look at providing comfort to users using responsive materials that react to temperature, light, humidity and air quality \cite{fragkia2020exergy, holstov2015hygromorphic}. These works are often in the form of ``optimally informative" systems such as temperature calendars, air quality forecasts, noise level indicators, and wearables that appropriately inform occupants of their environment and also allow them to engage with comfort parameters to certain degrees  \cite{costanza2016bit, kim2020designing}. Other works take a ``gamified" approach to engage users with their environment and activities in a socially inclusive manner \cite{mathur2015tiny, zhong2022augmenting}. 

% Our perspective
Therefore, much of the work towards developing human-centric buildings focus on changing the environmental variables that may in turn impact the occupants' experiences. Instead, in this position paper, we wish to reconsider the design of human-centric buildings through the perspective of occupant emotions, i.e. empathic buildings that understand and respond to human emotions.


% \section{Towards Empathic Experiences in Buildings}
\blue{\section{Towards Empathic Buildings For Understanding Occupants' Emotions}}

\label{sec:empathic-buildings}
% Why empathic buildings
One significant consequence of smart buildings is the fact that occupants find themselves physically immersed within an interactive object, and therefore experience interactions in a multi-sensory manner \cite{nembrini2017human}. There is therefore the potential for understanding the nature of such interactions, and designing empathic buildings that can infer occupants' emotions and shape the ways in which occupants experience the building. We next discuss how existing buildings can be made empathic from an HCI perspective by identifying three artifacts in an existing smart building.  
 

\subsection{A Digital Building of the Present}
\label{subsec:building}
Our motivation for designing empathic buildings stems from occupying and experiencing a digital building that houses students, researchers, entrepreneurs, and businesses. The building, labelled as an ``intelligent hub", was primarily designed to be human-centric from an architectural standpoint, with a vision to be sustainable, circular and flexible, healthy, and inspiring \footnote{https://link-anonymised-for-blind-review/}. Spaces in the building have been designed to elicit specific human emotions \cite{silo_michiel_2022}. Different artifacts in the interior and exterior have been designed using a variety of materials and design features. The building aims to encourage openness in the lower floors - a glass atrium is used to convey the feeling of transparency to occupants who can view all ongoing activities of the building. A combination of colourful plinth, and display of digital artifacts are used to make occupants feel curious and stimulate collaboration. Quietness and concentration in the upper zones are indicated by specific placement of work spaces, lighting and acoustic treatment. A combination of intelligent sensors throughout the building control light, temperature, and air quality to provide for comfort based on the number of occupants, and external and indoor environmental conditions. \blue{However, we question the effectiveness of relying solely on architectural design to create positive experiences for occupants. We find that the building may fall short in terms of being truly human-centric and empathic towards occupants because of its inability to sense occupants' emotions and \textit{"intelligently"} reciprocate to those emotions in an empathic manner.}

\caption{Examples of architectural and digital artefacts designed to invoke specific emotions in the occupants of a smart building.} \label{fig:lab42-examples}
\end{figure}

\blue{Figure \ref{fig:lab42-examples} shows three tangible artifacts which are incorporated into the building's design to induce positive emotions among occupants. However, the nature of the emotions that they actually elicit from the building's occupants raises questions. We speculate on the shortcomings of these artifacts and imagine how intelligent alternatives could be employed towards truly occupant-empathic buildings.}

\subsubsection*{The Privacy Curtains}
Figures \ref{fig:curtain} and \ref{fig:curtain-sheer} show curtains around certain work spaces in the middle of high-traffic corridors. The curtains serve as a means of providing a sense of privacy and recluse amidst the open and public spaces. However, the sheer material provides transparency and therefore, the clash between privacy and a sheer curtain creates a feeling of confusion and frustration regarding its purpose. An empathic curtain could however intelligently transition between different levels of opacity based on occupants privacy needs. \blue{We envision an intelligent curtain that may be embedded with sensors at the seams that can measure occupants' breathing rate, voice intonation changes, environmental sound levels or even body posture to infer positive vs non-positive affective states. For example, upon sensing occupant distress based on foot (or pen) tapping sounds \cite{lu2012stresssense}, the curtains could empathically respond by transitioning to greater opacity to provide a sense of calm.} 

\subsubsection*{An Encouraging Staircase}
The building promotes its staircase in Figures \ref{fig:staircase} and \ref{fig:staircase-railing} as being designed to inspire people to climb stairs rather than use the lift (which is tucked away in a corner of the building). However, the design by itself fails to draw occupants to use it - cold and textured wrought iron railings discourages touch and the black, oversized, and floating structure casts a foreboding  shadow on the onlooker, evoking a feeling of awe - something to observe, rather than use. An empathic staircase that inspires movement or enables physical comfort could benefit from gamification or anthropomorphisation. \blue{We envision steps with built-in pressure sensors and digital displays that in-situ infer body statistics and show calories burnt upon climbing to motivate occupants. Alternatively, the railings of the staircase could be embedded with sweat rate sensors that sense nervousness of an occupant headed towards an interview or an exam and turns  a few degrees warmer to provide physical comfort \cite{sim2018wearable}.}
 

\subsubsection*{The Digital Interface to the Building}
A large screen in the building foyer accompanied by an interface allows users to explore and learn different aspects about the building \blue{(for e.g. the types of on-going research)}. The screen gives the impression of a digital building attempting to communicate with its occupants. This placement triggers intrigue and a desire to learn more about the building. However, limited information displayed prevents the device from becoming part of an occupant's daily practice (such as the practice of checking one's phone every morning). We envision that a conversational user interface (CUI) may be able to serve as an empathic medium between the non-digital aspects of the building through a digital means. \blue{The building could be personified and represented by a voice-based agent that can talk with occupants who wish to do so. The voice-agent could be designed speak with different levels of voice intonations that convey emotions such as assurance to occupants who are frustrated when unable to find a particular room or a free space to work \cite{kuhne2020human}.}

\blue{While we suggest different means to enhance the above three artefacts towards an empathic building, we rely on the use of sensors and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Accurately sensing occupants' emotions requires a degree of data collection that may be deemed privacy-invasive and unethical. Less privacy-invasive human sensing modalities should be considered that may be anonymised to different degrees such as voice features, pupil movements or posture detection \cite{siddiqui2021respiration, larradet2020toward}. This would be in contrast to collecting the more privacy invasive facial data \cite{bullington2005affective}. Moreover, there are also risks to inference of human emotions. Incorrect evaluation of an occupant's affective state may result in an inappropriate response that may led to occupant distrust and avoidance in using the building.}

% Our proposed case study
\subsection{Our Proposed Case Study} 
Keeping in mind the need for empathic buildings, we wish to identify artifacts or spaces in buildings where architectural \blue{elements} fall short and so could benefit from a more digital design. As a step towards developing such an empathic \blue{building} that can infer occupant emotions, we are undertaking a preliminary case study in the aforementioned building. We first aim to identify occupants' novel and subjective experiences that arise from interactions with and within the smart building. We are particularly interested in understanding occupants' experiences of comfort (based on the indoor environment) and emotions, which is key in built environments \cite{alavi2017comfort}.  We then wish to identify specific influential factors (tangible and intangible) that determine the overall sense of comfort and the emotions experienced in smart building spaces. The case study comprises two phases: (a) emotion and comfort label collection, and (b) a building walk. In the first phase, we will conduct a short survey to obtain a large quantity of occupant derived emotion and comfort information which is grounded in different locations in the building. In the second phase, a building walk will be organised to obtain an in-depth understanding of occupants' perceptions - mental, emotional and physical - towards different spaces in the building.

During the walk, researchers will engage participants in conversations about each space, and conversations will form around what users expect of an empathic building of the future. Questions will investigate different experiential levels (sensory, interpretive, affective and performative) and probe occupants' impressions of the space, usage of space \textit{(Why do you use this space? What kind of tasks would you perform in this space?)}, emotions in the space \textit{(What emotions do you associate with this space?)}, comfort \textit{(Is this space comfortable? Is there sufficient light, warmth, ventilation?)}, shortcomings and scope for improvement. Data collected from both phases will be analysed using both thematic and lexical analysis \cite{braun2006using, xue2020mood}. 


\subsection{Expected Contributions}
We wish to identify where buildings fall short of \blue{being empathic towards its occupants} and how occupants envision that this could be achieved. Through our case study, we aim to identify specific artifacts (tangible and intangible), as well as the properties of these artifacts that impact the building occupants' emotions. Additionally, we expect to gain an understanding of the lived-in bodily and emotional experiences within smart spaces from a sensory, affective, and interpretive perspective \cite{giaccardi2015foundations}. Our work is a preliminary step towards the design and development of spaces that can understand and respond to the emotional needs of occupants. Results from our findings may be used towards the creation of novel emotion-eliciting experiences that occupants might currently find lacking in smart buildings (e.g. a sense of autonomy and control in an automated building) \cite{moreno2014user}, or enhance certain other experiences (e.g. a feeling of groundedness and familiarity in a space used by many) \cite{rehman2022personalisedcomfort}.  

\section{Conclusion}
The increased complexity of built environments in recent years can be attributed to a growing expectation for buildings to adapt to changing socio-environmental parameters. Given the inevitable transition of buildings into digital spaces, we put forth the need for spaces that cater to the full spectrum of human needs and experiences. In this position paper, we recommend the need for empathic buildings that can understand and respond to occupants' subjective needs. \blue{We discuss how three architectural artefacts in an existing digital building can be be understood, re-designed and thereby enhanced to be empathic towards occupants' subjective emotions. To that end, we highlight a case study that we are undertaking to identify how this digital building is experienced by its occupants. Moreover, we wish to understand we can design an empathic building of the future that can sense occupants' subjective emotions and respond accordingly towards improved occupant well-being.} Our findings may serve as a qualitative first step towards \blue{identifying artefacts that can be technologically enhanced to be more empathic towards occupants} and therefore serve as catalysts for improved human experiences in buildings. 


% As an alternate to architecturally driven empathic design, we discuss how digital artifacts (tangible and intangible) in smart buildings can be examined, understood and thereby designed for occupants' subjective needs and experiences.
