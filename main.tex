Given that people spend a significant amount of time within buildings, designing spaces considering the impact that they may have on occupants’ well being is a challenge. While architecture relies on design practices to elicit positive experiences among occupants, they may fall short in terms of sensing occupants and reciprocating to their needs in an empathic manner. Therefore, in this position paper we argue for the need of empathic technologies to shape buildings of the digital age. We believe that buildings that can empathically interact with occupants will enhance occupants’ experiences of well being in indoor spaces. We describe the architectural attributes of one such  smart building that attempts to evoke human emotions and experiences, yet falls short of being empathic. To that end, we talk of a preliminary case study that we will undertake towards identification of novel, subjective human experiences that can be provided by empathic buildings.

\section{Introduction}

% Buildings of the Digital Era
Humans are spending a significant amount of time inside increasingly digital buildings \cite{alavi2016future}. Information and communication technologies (ICT) and building energy management systems (BEMS) have resulted in buildings transforming from inanimate structures into interactive and communicative objects \cite{nembrini2017human}. Human occupancy of such spaces results in unfamiliar human-human and human-building interactions whereby buildings now play a more intuitive role in impacting humans. And although buildings of the digital age can intelligently react to environmental variables ( for eg., temperature, light, and air quality) to be energy efficient \cite{bluyssen2009indoor, moreno2014user}, the buildings human-centric and empathic behaviour towards occupants remain under-explored. 

% Empathic design for buildings
For humans, empathy is experienced and conveyed through emotional exchanges based on human experiences. The emotions expressed can be in the form of voice and speech patterns, facial expressions, body language, and behavioural patterns \cite{riess2017science}. These cues are recognised by humans who infer and respond accordingly. Empathy design in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) has therefore focused on developing methods to enable digital technologies to provide ``for the full range of human experience." \cite{wright2008empathy}. With the digitisation of buildings, there is a need to consider them as a digital artefact that can cater to the full spectrum of human experiences \cite{derix2014empathic}. 

% position
In this position paper, we consider buildings of the digital age that combine architecture with intelligent artefacts. These buildings can enable novel sensory perception of spaces by humans and thereby novel human-building interactions. We posit the need for empathic design of buildings that can infer occupants affective states and interact with occupants in a manner that caters to their subjective experiences towards occupant well being. 

% paper outline
The remainder of this paper provides a background on architecture in the digital age and the move towards architectural solutions that cater to humans. We then talk about one such smart building and speculate how it can be made empathic. To that end, we describe our case study as a preliminary step towards designing empathic buildings by understanding the needs and experiences of occupants of the smart building. 

% % comfort
% A key aspect of human experience within built environments (and by extension smart environments) is derived from the physical and emotional comfort of the occupants \cite{alavi2017comfort}. This subjective comfort which is largely as a result of qualities of the built environment can play a role in impacting the occupants awareness and behaviour within that environment.  



\section{Background}
% HBI
Architecture in recent years has started questioning a technologically driven, user-centric design of space as urban densification, sustainability and mental health have become an increasing priority \cite{derix2014empathic}. On the other hand, Human-building interaction (HBI) is a burgeoning area of research that focuses on capturing, understanding and enhancing human interactions and experiences both with and within ``smart built environments" \cite{alavi2016future}. The mutual goal of these fields being  understanding,  envisioning and shaping the future of living spaces and all that they encompass \cite{nembrini2017human, alavi2018artifacts}. 

% Examples of work in buildings catering to human needs
In this context, there are several interdisciplinary works that try to develop human-centric and responsible buildings. Smart, sustainable building facades for example are being developed that adapt to the external environment and react in an energy efficient manner \cite{ahmed2015development}. Other works look at providing comfort to users using responsive materials that react to temperature, light, humidity and air quality \cite{fragkia2020exergy, holstov2015hygromorphic}. These works are often in the form of ``optimally informative" systems such as temperature calendars, air quality forecasts, noise level indicators, and wearables that appropriately inform occupants of their environment and also allow them to engage with comfort parameters to certain degrees  \cite{costanza2016bit, kim2020designing}. Other works focus on a ``gamified" approach to engage users with their environment and activities in a socially inclusive manner \cite{mathur2015tiny, zhong2022augmenting}. 

% Our perspective
Therefore, much of the work towards developing human-centric buildings focus on changing the environmental variables that may in turn impact the occupants experiences. Instead, in this position paper we wish to reconsider the design of human-centric buildings through the perspective of occupant emotions ie. empathic buildings that understand and respond to human emotions.

\todo{should we also talk about the concept of comfort in HBI?}
% % Comfort in Built Environment
% The concept of comfort is central to occupants within built environments. Comfort is understood as occupants' physiological and affective (emotional) responses to the built environment \cite{alavi2017comfort}. HBI especially examines the relationship between occupant comfort and four physical characteristics of the indoor environment - temperature, air, light, and sound \cite{hawkes2007environmental, bluyssen2009indoor}. 




\section{Towards Empathic Experiences in Buildings}
\label{sec:empathic-buildings}
% Why empathic buildings
A significant consequence of smart buildings is that occupants find themselves physically immersed within an interactive object, and therefore experience interactions in a multi-sensory manner \cite{nembrini2017human}. There is a potential for understanding the nature of such interactions, and designing empathic buildings that can infer occupants' emotions and shape the ways in which occupants experience the building. We next talk about how existing buildings can be made empathic from an HCI perspective by identifying three artifacts in an existing smart building.  
 

\subsection{A Digital Building of the Present}
\label{subsec:building}
Our motivation for designing empathic buildings comes from occupying and experiencing a digital building that houses students, researchers, entrepreneurs, and businesses. The building labelled as an ``intelligent hub" was primarily designed to be empathic from an architectural standpoint, with a vision to be sustainable, circular and flexible, healthy, and inspiring \footnote{https://lab42.uva.nl/}. Spaces in the building have been designed to elicit specific human emotions \cite{silo_michiel_2022}. Different artifacts in the interior and exterior have been designed using a variety of materials and design features. The building aims to encourage openness in the lower floors - a glass atrium is used to convey the feeling of transparency to occupants who can view all ongoing activities of the building. A combination of colourful plinth, and display of digital artifacts are used to make occupants feel curious and stimulate collaboration. Quietness and concentration in the upper zones are indicated by specific placement of work spaces, lighting and acoustic treatment. A combination of intelligent sensors throughout the building control light, temperature, and air quality to provide for comfort based on the number of occupants, and external and indoor environmental conditions. However, we question the suitability of relying only on architectural design for invoking emotions and empathy in buildings.

\caption{Materials in a smart building that raise questions about its nature and the type of experience it provides to the buildings occupants.} \label{fig:lab42-examples}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:lab42-examples} shows three tangible artifacts in the building designed to be empathic from an architectural standpoint, but raise questions about the nature of their role in interacting with the building occupants. We speculate on the shortcomings of these artifacts and imagine how intelligent alternatives could be employed towards truly empathic buildings.

\subsubsection*{The Privacy Curtains}
Figures \ref{fig:curtain} and \ref{fig:curtain-sheer} show curtains around certain work spaces in the middle of high-traffic corridors. The curtains serve as a means of providing a sense of privacy and recluse amidst the open and public spaces. However, the sheer material provides transparency and therefore, the clash between privacy and a sheer curtain creates a feeling of confusion and frustration regarding its purpose. An empathic curtain could however intelligently transition between different levels of opacity based on occupants privacy needs (for eg., upon sensing anxiety or distraction).  

\subsubsection*{An Encouraging Staircase}
The building promotes its staircase in Figures \ref{fig:staircase} and \ref{fig:staircase-railing} as being designed to inspire people to climb stairs rather than use the lift. However, the design by itself fails to draw occupants to use it - cold and textured wrought iron railings discourages touch and the black, oversized, and floating structure casts a foreboding  shadow on the onlooker,  evoking a feeling of awe - something to observe, rather than use. An empathic staircase that inspires movement could benefit from gamification or anthropomorphisation that for example shows calories burnt or muscles exercised as a motivator. 

\subsubsection*{The Digital Interface to the Building}
A large screen in the building foyer accompanied by an interactive interface allows users to explore and learn different things about the building. The screen presents itself a digital building attempting to be transparent and communicate with its occupants. This placement triggers intrigue in learning more about the building. However, limited information displayed prevents the device from becoming part of an occupant's daily practice (such as checking one's phone every morning). We envision that a conversational user interface (CUI) may be able to serve as an emphatic medium between the non-digital aspects of the building through a digital means. 

% Our proposed case study
\subsection{Our Proposed Case Study} 
Keeping in mind the need for empathic buildings, we wish to identify artifacts or spaces in buildings where architectural features of empathy design fall short and so could benefit from a more digital design. Towards developing such an empathic architecture that can infer occupant emotions, we are undertaking a preliminary case study in the aforementioned building. We first aim to identify occupants' novel and subjective experiences that arise from interactions with and within the smart building. We are particularly interested in understanding experiences of occupant comfort (based on the indoor environmental) and emotions which is key in built environments \cite{alavi2017comfort}.  We wish to thereafter identify specific influential factors (tangible and intangible) that determine the overall sense of comfort and emotions in smart buildings spaces. The case study comprises two phases: (a) emotion and comfort label collection, and (b) building walk. First, we will conduct a short survey to obtain a large number of occupant emotion and comfort information based on different spaces in the building. Next, a building walk will be organised to obtain an in-depth understanding of occupants' perceptions - mental, emotional and physical towards different spaces in the building.

During the walk, researchers will engage participants in conversations about each space, and conversations will form around what users expect of an empathic building of the future. Questions will investigate different experiential levels (sensory, interpretive, affective and performative) and will include asking about impressions of the space, usage of space \textit{(How would you use this space? Why do you use this space? What kind of tasks would you perform in this space?)}, emotions in the space \textit{(What emotions do you associate with this space?)}, comfort \textit{(Is this space comfortable? Is there sufficient light, warmth, ventilation?)}, shortcomings and scope for improvement. Data collected from both phases will be analysed using thematic analysis, and lexical analysis \cite{braun2006using, xue2020mood}. 

% \subsection{Privacy Considerations}
\todo{Should we add privacy considerations}

\subsection{Expected Contributions}
We wish to identify where buildings fall short of being understood as empathic and how occupants envision that be achieved. Through our case study, we aim to identify specific artifacts (tangible and intangible), and the properties of these artifacts that impact building occupants' emotions. Additionally, we expect to gain an understanding of the lived-in body and emotional experiences within smart learning spaces from a sensory, affective, and interpretive perspective \cite{giaccardi2015foundations}. 
Our work is a preliminary step towards design and development of spaces that can understand and assist in the emotional needs of occupants. Results from our findings may be used towards creation of novel emotion-eliciting experiences that occupants might find lacking in smart buildings (for eg., sense of autonomy and control in an automated building) \cite{moreno2014user}, or enhance certain other experiences (for eg., feeling of groundedness and familiarity in a space used by many) \cite{rehman2022personalisedcomfort}.  
\section{Conclusion}
The increased complexity of built environments in recent years can be attributed to a growing expectation for buildings to adapt to changing socio-environmental parameters. Given the inevitable transition buildings into digital spaces, we put forth the need for spaces that cater to the full spectrum of human needs and experiences. In this position paper, we recommend the need for empathic buildings that can understanding and respond to occupants' subjective needs. As an alternate to architecturally driven empathic design, we discuss how digital artifacts (tangible and intangible) in smart buildings can be examined, understood and thereby designed for occupants' subjective needs and experiences. To that end, we highlight a case study that will serve as a qualitative first step towards identifying how one such smart building may fall short of empathic, and therefore needs rethinking such that they may serve as catalysts for improved human experiences.
